              Last week, residents at Henderson House got together for a floral arranging workshop, part of PCLA's Art Therapy initiative. What began as a simple holiday activity became something more: a chance to create, connect, and feel proud of what they had made.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              Staff described the afternoon as relaxed and genuinely joyful. Residents worked together easily, sharing ideas and taking visible pride in their arrangements. By the end, coffee tables across the house were filled with colorful displays that residents pointed to as "theirs": a small but meaningful sense of ownership and accomplishment.
            </Paragraph>

              alt="PCLA residents"
              caption="PCLA residents enjoyed the day"
            />

            <Quote>
              "It really was a lovely afternoon thoroughly enjoyed by all. - Leah, a resident of PCLA" 
            </Quote>

              alt="PCLA residents floral arangements"
              caption="PCLA residents floral arrangeing"
            />

            <Paragraph>
              The session worked because it brought together three things PCLA prioritizes: creative expression, opportunities to build confidence, and connection. Residents who usually hang back were more animated. Others found the process calming and grounding. Staff are already planning a follow-up for February around Valentine's Day.
            </Paragraph>

              alt="Flower arranging at Rainbow Lodge"
              caption="Flower arranging at PCLA's Rainbow Lodge"
            />

            <Paragraph>
              The feedback was consistent: it was simple, but it mattered. People felt proud and part of something together. As Leah put it afterward, "It really was a lovely afternoon thoroughly enjoyed by all." For residents navigating complex mental health challenges, these moments count, they reinforce community and the sense of home PCLA works to build every day.
